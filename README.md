# Breast Cancer Diagnosis App

The **Breast Cancer Diagnosis App** is a machine learning-based tool designed to assist healthcare professionals in 
evaluating breast cancer cases. By analyzing specific medical measurements, the app predicts whether a tumor
is **benign** or **malignant**. It also provides a visual representation of the input data using a
**radar chart** and displays the predicted classification along with the probability for each outcome.

## Features
- Predicts **benign** or **malignant** breast tumors based on input measurements.
- Displays a **radar chart** for visualizing the provided data.
- Shows the **probability score** for each classification.
- Accepts **manual input** or can be configured to receive data from a laboratory system (external integration, not part of the app).

## Dataset
This project was developed using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, a publicly available dataset for machine learning practice. Since this dataset may not be entirely reliable, the app is strictly for **educational purposes** and not intended for clinical or professional medical use.
